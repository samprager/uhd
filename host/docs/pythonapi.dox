/*! \page page_python Python API

UHD supports a Python API, in case the C++ or C APIs are not the right solution
for your application.

\section python_install Installing the Python API

In order to install the Python API when building UHD from source, make sure all
the dependencies are available (see also \ref page_build_guide, you need
Boost.Python from your Boost library). Make sure you have the CMake variable
`ENABLE_PYTHON_API` set to ON (e.g., by running `cmake -DENABLE_PYTHON_API=ON`).

\subsection python_install_2v3 Python 2 vs. 3

The Python API supports both Python 2 and 3, but if you have both versions
installed, CMake might require some hints which version is the desired one.
To force Python 3, UHD has a CMake variable `ENABLE_PYTHON3`. If you set it,
e.g., by running `cmake -DENABLE_PYTHON3=ON`, it will force the usage of
Python 3.

\subsection python_install_windows Installing on Windows

On Windows, only certain combinations of MSVC and Boost have proven functional.
The following combinations are known to work (others might also work):

- Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.7.3), Release X64 on Windows 10 with Boost
  1.65.1 and Boost 1.66, Python27 x64 bit.

Static linking on is currently unsupported on Windows.

\section python_usage Using the Python API

The Python API mirrors the C++ API, so the C++ reference manual can be used to
understand the behaviour of the Python API as well.

Names in the Python API have been modified to follow a PEP8-compatible naming
convention, for example, uhd::usrp::multi_usrp in C++ corresponds to
uhd.usrp.MultiUSRP in Python (this makes UHD/Python code implicitly compatible
with most linters, but it also has the side-effect of hiding symbols that get
imported from the C++ domain).
The following two snippets are equivalent. First the C++ version:
~~~{.cpp}
#include <uhd/usrp/multi_usrp.hpp>

// ...

auto usrp = uhd::usrp::multi_usrp::make("type=b200");
usrp->set_rx_freq(100e6);
~~~

Now the Python version:
~~~{.py}
import uhd

# ...

usrp = uhd.usrp.MultiUSRP("type=b200")
usrp.set_rx_freq(100e6)
~~~

Not all API calls from the C++ API are also supported in the Python API, and
the Python API has some additional functions that are not available in C++, but
for the most part, the uhd::usrp::multi_usrp API is identical.

\section python_usage_oneoff One-off transmit/receive applications

A common type of Python-based SDR applications are those which produce or
consume a limited number of samples. For example, an application could receive a
second's worth of samples, then do offline processing, print the result, and
exit. For this case, convenience API calls were added to the Python API. The
following snippet is an example of how to store 1 second of samples acquired at
1 Msps:

~~~{.py}
import uhd

def recv_to_file():
    """RX samples and write to file"""
    usrp = uhd.usrp.MultiUSRP("type=b200")
    num_samps = 1e6
    if not isinstance(args.channels, list):
        args.channels = [args.channels]
    samps = usrp.recv_num_samps(
        1e6, # Number of samples
	2.4e9, # Frequency in Hz
	1e6, # Sampling rate
	[0], # Receive on channel 0
	80, # 80 dB of RX gain
    )
    samps.tofile('samples.dat')
~~~

This kind of API is particularly useful in combination with Jupyter Notebooks or
similar interactive environments.
