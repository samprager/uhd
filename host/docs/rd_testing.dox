/*! \page page_rdtesting R&D Testing Procedures

All defined R&D test procedures are listed here. These tests are meant as a tool
for Ettus R&D to enable faster and more reliable development. Note these tests
are no replacement for manufacturing or production tests, and should not be
treated as such. Instead, they are meant to catch common failure modes during
development. As a result, test definitions are fairly light-weight.

\subsection rdtesting_gpsdo_recommendations Recommendations

For cursory testing, not all tests within a device family are required (e.g.,
only testing the OCXO on any X-Series, and testing the TCXO on any B-Series is
sufficient).

The following tests are recommended for a minimum test (N stands for the latest
version of this test):
- One of GPS-X310-OCXO-vN or GPS-X300-OCXO-vN
- One of GPS-B210-TCXO-vN or GPS-B200-TCXO-vN

\subsection rdtesting_gpsdo_requirements Requirements

All of these tests require a device that is GPSDO capable (e.g., X3x0, B2x0,
N2x0). For those devices that have a separate GPS component (such as the Jackson
Labs GPSDOs), this component is also required (called the "peripheral" in the
following).

\subsection rdtesting_gpsdo_manual GPSDO: Manual Test Procedure

1. Without connecting the peripheral to the device, run `uhd_usrp_probe` on the
   device and verify that the lack of GPSDO is correctly reported. No warning
   or error must be printed.
2. This and the following tests are run with the peripheral connected: Run
   `uhd_usrp_probe` and verify that the GPSDO is correctly reported. Power down
   the device before connecting the peripheral. The GPSDO must be reported
   found, and no error or warning must be printed.
3. Without connecting the GPS antenna input, run `query_gpsdo_sensors`. To pass,
   it must report the GPSDO as found, lock to the external reference, but then
   report not being locked to GPS. The tool will report a valid GPS time, and
   a string such as "GPS and UHD Device time are aligned" in case of success.
4. Connect a GPS antenna to the input and make sure it is in a position to
   receive GPS satellite data. Confirm that GPS lock is reported using
   `query_gpsdo_sensors` within 20 minutes of connecting the antenna.
   The tool `query_gpsdo_sensors` will print a string such as "GPS Locked" in
   case of success.

All of these tests must pass for a 'pass' validation.

\section rdtesting_defining Defining R&D Tests

Tests can be added any time to define procedures for pass/fail validation. Any
test must include the following:

- An unambiguous test code. This code consists of three characters that
  identify the test, a short description of the devices required, and a version
  suffix. Example: `GPS-X310-OCXO-v1` is a GPS-related test, requires an X310
  and an OCXO to run, and is version 1 of this test.
- A manual testing procedure. This must unambiguously define a set of tasks,
  and clearly identify whether or not a test has failed or passed. Tests do not
  require any other defined outcome other than 'pass' and 'fail'.
- Optional, but highly recommended: An automatic test procedure. This must
  consist of a command, or a script, or a set of commands that can be
  automatically executed, and that will report a failure condition by means of
  returning a non-zero return value.

Basic understanding of the operation of USRPs by the test operator should be
assumed when authoring test procedures. The descriptions should be as short as
possible to fully describe, unambiguously, how to reach a pass/fail conclusion.

Test procedures may be updated at any time. If this happens, a new test code
must be generated, with the version number increased. Old test codes are
considered deprecated (if there exists a version 2 of a test, version 1 should
not be run any more).
