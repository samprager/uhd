uhd (3.10.1.1-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  - Docs: The protocol for Gen-3 devices is now consistently referred to as CHDR.
  - X300: Fixed EEPROM corruption bug (happened when two processes would access
    find routines on the same device at the same time). Improved initialization
    time. CE clock is now 214 MHz. Fixed channel list generation. Find routines
    now more lenient in case one devices fails (others can still be found then).
    Improve PCIe behaviour. Fix timed commands for non-TwinRX dboards. Improve
    AXI Interconnect (faster, improved build timing).
  - N230: Use second_addr (like X300).
  - C API: Added UHD_VERSION macro. Fixed online rate change.
  - Utils: Minor fixes to uhd_images_downloader.
  - Build/CMake: Fixed some Py3k build issues. Fixed many compiler warnings. Allow
    to specify package names.
  - RFNoC: Fixed sampling rate mismatch error. Noc-Shell uses a non-cascaded 2-clk
    FIFO. Increase default FIFO sizes on DUC and DDC blocks.
  - UBX: Force on RX driver to eliminate transient.
  - Transport code: Fixed memory leak.
  - FPGA repository: Merged usrp3_rfnoc and usrp3 directories again. Cleaned up
    superfluous files. Clean separation between Gen-3 and other devices in usrp3.

uhd (3.10.1.0-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  - Fixed multiple compiler warnings
  - Multiple documentation fixes
  - X300: RX strobe lines are always in sync on device initialization. DB EEPROM
    now properly written. ignore-cal-file no longer ignored. Fixed case where too
    large recv_frame_size settings could break things. Reduced ZPU clock speed
    (helps FPGA timing). Added area constraints for AXI interconnect. Improved
    halfband scaling in rx_frontend. Improved PCIe streaming reliability
  - B2xx: Clear sequence numbers in idle state.
  - RFNoC: Nodes disconnect on destruction. Fixed setting of correct bits on
    sr_error_policy. DDC does no longer clear timed commands on EOB. DUC fixed
    timed CORDIC tuning. Enable Noc-Shell response FIFOs (fixes simultaneous
    commands on multiple channels).
  - UBX: Changed default performance parameters
  - TwinRX: LEDs properly light up depending on channels. Fixed issue of multiple
    (redundant) writes. Simplified API steps for phase synchronization
  - XCVR: Query dboard clock instead of DAC clock. Helps in X3x0s.
  - GPS: Fixed message for case when no GPS is present. Fixed multiple GPS-related
    issues.
  - Converters: Fixed floating point rounding error in tests.
  - Utils: uhd_usrp_probe can now query vectors
  - Fixed issue that prevented soft_regs working on 32-bit systems
  - Tools: Merged dissectors into common directory.
  - CMake: -Og is the default now for gcc-based Debug builds.
